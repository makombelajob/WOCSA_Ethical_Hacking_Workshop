# Introduction

## What is a Bad USB?
A Bad USB is a type of USB device that is designed to exploit a computer's USB port. This can be used to steal data, install malware, or even take control of the computer. Bad USB attacks are a type of attack that uses a USB device to exploit a computer's USB port.

## How bad USB works?
The USB microcontroller chip that contains the firmware is used to identify the type of device that's connected and its capabilities. Once the firmware is compromised, it's just a matter of time until the hacker reverse engineers the USB device to insert the malicious code within the workstation. This exposes the organization to a whole range of security attacks, such as logic bombs, data theft, ransomware, and more.

## Why is it dangerous?
Bad USB attacks are dangerous because they can be used to steal data, install malware, or even take control of the computer. This can be done without the user's knowledge, and can be very difficult to detect.

Create a Bad USB could be cheap for a hacker and not very difficult. You can find affordable Bad USB, looking like really USB, on the internet. The hacker just needs to plug the Bad USB into the computer and wait for the attack to be executed. And because it is a physic attack, no one would be aware of it! One example you can find is in ["Mister Robot"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x0vl6ikO5M) series ðŸ˜‰.

## How to protect yourself?
To protect yourself from Bad USB attacks, you should be careful about what USB devices you connect to your computer. You should also keep your computer's software up to date, and use antivirus software to protect against malware. In enterprises, you can use a USB port blocker to prevent unauthorized USB devices from being connected to your computer or deactivate USB ports.

# Workshop

## Setup
### Requirements
Here, we will use Digispark arduino board to create a Bad USB. The Digispark is a microcontroller board that is based on the ATtiny85. It is similar to the Arduino, but it is much smaller and cheaper. The Digispark can be programmed using the Arduino IDE, and it can be used to create a Bad USB. You can find the Digispark on the internet for a few dollars.

### Installation of the Arduino IDE
You can find all the instructions for Windows installation [here](./Installation/InstallArduinoIDEWindows.md) and for Linux installation [here](./Installation/InstallArduinoIDELinux.md).
