# Java Dummy
The goal of this challenge is to introduce participants to bytecode. More in general, the goal is to show that there is no "one-tool-fits-all" in reverse engineering.
To achieve the best results, I recomment to use jADX-GUI (java decompiler with a graphical user interface)
The solve itself is pretty self forward when examined in the tool.
